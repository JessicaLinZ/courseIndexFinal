        <p>
          I based my project around my interactions with <a id="humanBenchmark" href="https://humanbenchmark.com/">Human Benchmark</a> tests. This site has a number of different tests that measure things like memory, reaction speed. typing speed, and more.
          Since there is already a lot of quantitative data built into the site, I used the varying statistics from the site to track if there were any changes in my performance based on the weather, time of day, and lighting conditions. As for the qualitative data, I took notes on the
          emotional and somatic responses that occurred while doing the tests. I thought it'd be fairly easy to show the quantitative data in the form of type, so I decided to rely on colour and motion to demonstrate the qualitative information. This way, I could control speed to
          reflect my mental state and/or energy levels while taking the tests, and how the lighting may have affected my mood. While making my infographic, however, I spent most of the time worrying about the motion, and didn't have enough time to implement colour as much as I wanted to.
        </p>

          Originally, I intended to compare the results of different tests against each other. I wanted to show a total of 3 different tests in the same manner I did for the Verbal Memory test, where 5 different scores would be shown for each of the 3 times of day I did my research.
          Unfortunately, I couldn't do anymore than this one test due to time constraints. I think I managed to showcase a decent range of data in this one infographic, but part of my reason for wanting to multiple tests was so that I could take visual elements from the tests themselves.
          I feel that I wasn't able to show my actual interactions very well, so I wanted to use visual elements from different games to reference how I physically interacted with them as well. For example, the screen flashing red or green with my frustrations during the Reaction Speed test or
          or a grid of squares appearing and filling the screen.
          I think the test I chose to do first was the least visually interesting one, as the Verbal Memory test's interface only consists of 2 yellow buttons and a word displayed in the middle.
        </p>

          In spite of wanting to use visual elements from the site's tests, I feel like I may have relied too closely on the site's style and layout when I created my inforgraphic. Compositionally, I found that my composition's pretty simple, and doesn't necessarily make the best use of the video medium.
          Since the layout itself is static, there isn't a lot going on compositionally, and I don't make much use of things like the camera's movements or the viewer's position. I also think that I could have given my infographic a more personal connection to myself if I had put a little more thought into
          the font choice and hierarchy. I think I got too caught up in using the design elements that were already readily available to me versus coming up with my own unique style choices.
